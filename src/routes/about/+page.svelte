<h1 class="title">About</h1>

<p>
    In collaboration with the MTA, CityTech and Eco Rising are analyzing Subway temperatures across New York City MTA stations to observe patterns and analyze the <a
    href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands">urban heat island's effect</a
    > on underground subway stations.
    CityTech students are collecting temperatures at
    both the street level and platform level at these subway stations and through an analysis of temperatures collected, we will build an interactive
    dashboard that allows people to access generalized weather information
    through a geospatial web component.
</p>
<p>
    We are also working on creating a two-tiered forecast model that uses the
    temperatures collected to train a machine learning model that takes in daily
    temperatures and dates to predict street level temperatures and predict the
    temperatures inside of subway stations given the aforementioned analysis of
    historical subway records.

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
    New York City faces significant challenges due to the accelerating impacts
    of climate change. The most affected infrastructures are underground
    transportation systems, which are particularly vulnerable to the
    intensifying frequency and duration of heat waves. The fluctuation in
    temperature within the subway system during these extreme weather events
    poses serious health and safety risks not only to daily commuters but also
    transit employees working in these environments. Despite the potential
    dangers, the extent and dynamics of temperature changes within the subway
    remain insufficiently understood. To address this knowledge gap, this study
    conducts a comprehensive investigation into temperature variability across
    multiple subway stations in NYC, aiming to inform future mitigation
    strategies and urban planning.
